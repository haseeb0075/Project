I have selected my project dataset from https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GPP.
Under climate data I have choosen Pre and post production emission set.
Then, I Firstly selected different filters that were making complete sense of the dataset.
I downloaded the CSV file and has attached to the repository file.
I started working with ipynb in Vscode.
Instantly i started from presenting  Metadata, hypothesis and describing aims and objectives, importing libraries, uploading data and Data preprocessing.
In data visualization i have used technique of showing geographical interactive plots for each Element, Temporal Trends in Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Pre-Post Production Activities (1990-2021).
Then I used analysis of Emission in Pre and Post production Items separately.
Afterwards I have use Machine Learning Models with hyperperameters tunning in Pipelines and usind GridSearch CV and also provided with score comparison of each model for different matrics.
I have also used Cross Validation and Model Evaluation, and also provided with score comparison of each model for different matrics.
In the End I have presented feature importance step which shows important info regarding the features and categories impacting the most.
